ThreeD
======

Back in 2010 I wrote a little Garry's Mod Addon to place text in 3d space using a simple tool. Some people liked it.

10 years later, I uncovered the source code from a backup and decided to port it to the current version of the game (Garry's Mod 13+).

Installation and Usage
----------------------

Drop into `garrysmod/addons/threed`. I might also release this on the Workshop. Maybe.

A 'ThreeD Text' tool should appear within the Render group.
